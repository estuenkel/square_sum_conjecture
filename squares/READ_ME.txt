This folder contains all of the files necessary for proving the square sum conjecture.

"squares_glue.sagews" is dedicated to finding glue and then creating a text file that can be read later.
"squares_base_cases.sagews" is dedicated to finding base cases for whatever glue is found and creating a text file that can be read later.
"squares_generate_sequences.sagews" is dedicated to creating sequences of any length using the text files created for glue and base cases.

The provided text files are sufficient to prove that it is possible to find a Hamiltonian path on the integers from 1 to n where they have an edge between them if they sum to a square number. These files are sufficient to show that it is possible to only multiply sequences by 9 and still find glue that can be used to prove the square sum conjecture.
