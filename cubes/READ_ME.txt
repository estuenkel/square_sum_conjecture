This folder contains all of the files necessary for proving that there are infinitely many sequences where integers sum to cubes instead of squares.

"cubes.sagews" has all of the functions necessary for creating a text file and generating infinitely many viable sequences.

The provided text file is sufficient to prove that there are infinitely many Hamiltonian paths on the integers from 1 to n where there is an edge between them if they sum to a cube by reusing an existing base case and glue over and over again.
